        //Java TreeMap class is a red-black tree based implementation. It provides an efficient means of storing key-value pairs in sorted order.

        //The important points about Java TreeMap class are:
        //Java TreeMap contains values based on the key. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class.
        //Java TreeMap contains only unique elements.
        //Java TreeMap cannot have a null key but can have multiple null values.
        //Java TreeMap is non synchronized.
        //Java TreeMap maintains ascending order.

        //TreeMap vs HashMap
        //HashMap: HashMap can contain one null key. HashMap maintains no order.
        //TreeMap: TreeMap cannot contain any null key.	TreeMap maintains ascending order.
