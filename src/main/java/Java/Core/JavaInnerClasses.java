        //Java inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface.
        //We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place to be more readable and maintainable.
        //Additionally, it can access all the members of the outer class, including private data members and methods.

        //Advantage of Java inner classes
        //There are three advantages of inner classes in Java. They are as follows:
        //Nested classes represent a particular type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of the outer class, including private.
        //Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.
        //Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.

        //Difference between nested class and inner class in Java
        //An inner class is a part of a nested class. Non-static nested classes are known as inner classes.

        //Java Nested Interface
        //An interface, i.e., declared within another interface or class, is known as a nested interface. The nested interfaces are used to group related interfaces so that they can be easy to maintain. The nested interface must be referred to by the outer interface or class. It can't be accessed directly.
