        //Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
        //Object: An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
        //Class: Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
        //Inheritance: When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
        //Polymorphism: Polymorphism in Java means performing a single action in different ways. It means many forms. There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
        //Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
        //Encapsulation: Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.

        //Association:
        //Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:
        //One to One
        //One to Many
        //Many to One, and
        //Many to Many

        //Aggregation represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects. It is also termed as a has-a relationship in Java.

        //The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object. It is the state where containing objects do not have an independent existence. If you delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically.

        //What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?
        //Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are examples of object-based programming languages.
