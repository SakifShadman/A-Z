        //An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.

        //Object:
        //The object is an instance of a class.
        //The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
        //An object is a runtime entity.

        //A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
        //A class in Java can contain:
        //Fields
        //Methods
        //Constructors
        //Blocks
        //Nested class and interface

        //A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.

        //The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.

        //Ways to initialize object?
        //There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.
        //By reference variable
        //By method
        //By constructor
