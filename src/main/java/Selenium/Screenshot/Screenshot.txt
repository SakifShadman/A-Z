From selenium 4 we can take screenshot at element, section and also full-page level.
Element means for one particular web element.
Section means any particular table, form or block of element altogether.
Full-page screenshot can be takes two ways.
getScreenshotAs() – This Selenium 4 method allows us to capture a screenshot of a particular WebElement (only visible part of the website).
getFullPageScreenshotAs() – This method of Selenium 4 allows us to take full page screenshot in Firefox (top to bottom).
